/* Dummy SDL video driver implementation; this is just enough to make an
 *  SDL-based application THINK it's got a working video driver, for
 *  applications that call SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) when they don't need it,
 *  and also for use as a collection of stubs when porting SDL to a new
 *  platform for which you haven't yet written a valid video driver.
 *
 * This is also a great way to determine bottlenecks: if you think that SDL
 *  is a performance problem for a given platform, enable this driver, and
 *  then see if your application runs faster without video overhead.
 *
 * Initial work by Ryan C. Gordon (icculus@icculus.org). A good portion
 *  of this was cut-and-pasted from Stephane Peter's work in the AAlib
 *  SDL video driver.  Renamed to "DUMMY" by Sam Lantinga.
