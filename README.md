dosbox port for iOS, aka iDOS
# MSDOS for iOS

Updated app build settings to support iOS 10 or later. Initially this source code was built to run on older iOS 5 architectures, so hopefully this might run a whole lot faster on the latest hardware. 

### Supports Windows 95
I have not tried this yet, but DOSBox might be the best emulator for running Windows 95.
