#### Easy for Everyone
Hopefully, anyone with access to an iMac can use this Xcode project to have a fully fledged x86 emulator on their iOS device without too much trouble. 

# MSDOS for iOS 10 - iOS 12
Updated app build settings to support iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Initially this source code was built to run on older iOS 5 architectures, so hopefully this might run a whole lot faster on the latest hardware. 


## Getting Started
Included with this MS-DOS emulator is a copy of Warcraft II Alpha.
If you'd like to play more classic DOS games on your iOS device, simply move
directories containing your games to be alongside the `war2a` directory and volla!
You can copy and start playing Duke Nukem 3D in no time!
* Copy all your classic DOS games to the project folder: `/diskc/yourDOSgame`


## Supports Windows 95!
Follow the getting started guide above, it should guide you on how to access your virtual
C: drive. You'll need to copy a Windows95.img into that directory.
