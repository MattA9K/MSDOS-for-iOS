dosbox port for iOS, aka iDOS
# MSDOS for iOS 10 & Later

Updated app build settings to support iOS 10 or later. Initially this source code was built to run on older iOS 5 architectures, so hopefully this might run a whole lot faster on the latest hardware. 


## Getting Started
Included with this MS-DOS emulator is a copy of Warcraft II Alpha.
If you'd like to play more classic DOS games on your iOS device, simple move
directories containing your games to be alongside the `war2a` directory and volla!
You can copy and start playing Duke Nukem 3D in no time!
* Copy all your classic DOS games to the project folder: `/diskc/yourDOSgame`

## Supports Windows 95!
I have not tried this yet, but DOSBox might be the best emulator for running Windows 95.
Follow the getting started guide above, it should guide you on how to access your virtual
C: drive. You'll need to programatically copy a Windows95.img into that directory.
